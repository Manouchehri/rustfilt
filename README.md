Demangle Rust symbol names using (rustc-demangle)[https://github.com/alexcrichton/rustc-demangle]. `rustfilt` works similarly to `c++filt`, in that it accepts mangled symbol names as command line arguments, and if none are provided it accepts mangled symbols from stdin. Demangled symbols are written to stdout.
